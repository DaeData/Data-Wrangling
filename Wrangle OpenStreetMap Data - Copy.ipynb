Texas is all about barbeque and it is really surprising that for this area there is only one entry.  It could be that this area doesn't have a good representation of barbeque restaurants but I doubt that.  A quick look at Yelp tells me that this is indeed incorrect.  \n",

Google maps is too inconsistent and often does not take into account construction and other possible delay factors that is necessary to get around efficiently.  The potential for better information, quicker with accurate updates is avaiable through OpenStreetMap, but this dataset shows that not many people are aware that it exists.  841 unique contributors in a large portion of the metro is essentially demonstrating almost no one knows.  Perhaps if more people became aware of the rich data points available and knew that they could play an active role in the discovery of this amazing city we could see greater accuracy.
